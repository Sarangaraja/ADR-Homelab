# ðŸ§ª Deploying a Homelab for Simulated ATT&CK Scenarios

Cybersecurity is a continuous battle between attackers (Red Team) and defenders (Blue Team). To better understand this dynamic, I built a homelab featuring Active Directory (AD) to simulate **MITRE ATT&CK** scenarios in a controlled environment. The goal was to **capture attack logs using Splunk** and gain hands-on experience with detecting and mitigating threats in real time.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to safely simulate Red Team tactics and leverage Blue Team tools like Splunk to detect and mitigate threats in real time. Regular simulation and monitoring are key to staying ahead of evolving cybersecurity challenges.
