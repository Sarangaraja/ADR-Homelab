</h1>

Cybersecurity is a continuous battle between attackers (Red Team) and defenders (Blue Team). To better understand this dynamic, I built a homelab featuring Active Directory (AD) to simulate **MITRE ATT&CK** scenarios in a controlled environment. The goal was to **capture attack logs using Splunk** and gain hands-on experience with detecting and mitigating threats in real time.

‚∏ª

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This project demonstrates the interplay between offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations by:
	
 ‚Ä¢	**Deploying a Windows Active Directory Environment**: Setting up a domain controller, user accounts, and security policies.

	
 ‚Ä¢	**Simulating Attacks**: Conducting controlled adversarial attacks using techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

	
 ‚Ä¢	**Capturing & Analyzing Logs with Splunk**: Collecting and visualizing security logs to develop real-time detection capabilities.


‚∏ª
